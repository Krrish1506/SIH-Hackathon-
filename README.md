Al-Based Smart Allocation Engine for PM Internship Scheme , problem id:-25033,  
Description

The problem envisages a smart, automated system that uses AI/ML algorithms to match candidates with internship opportunities based on skills, qualifications, location preferences, and sector interests. The system should also account for affirmative action (e.g., representation from rural/aspirational districts, different social categories), past participation, and internship capacity of industries.
